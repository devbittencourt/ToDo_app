# To Do app

The To Do app was developed using the flet library, a tool for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. Some of the main technologies and concepts involved include:

Python: The primary programming language used to write the application logic.

flet: A library that provides a set of tools for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. It allows the construction of interface elements such as buttons, text fields, columns, rows, among others.

Task Control: The application uses a task control class to manage individual tasks. Each task is an object that can be edited, marked as completed, or deleted.

Task Filtering: It has a filtering mechanism that enables the user to view all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks.

Interface Responsiveness: The application's interface is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience. Additionally, the app is multi-platform, functioning across various operating systems.

Dynamic Updating: The interface is dynamically updated as actions are performed, such as adding, editing, or deleting tasks, ensuring that changes are instantly reflected in the user interface.
